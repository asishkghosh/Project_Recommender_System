Her emotions, however, are in turmoil when a letter arrives informing that Jane's eldest and beloved brother, George, who was participating on the expedition to the East, was executed. At the same time, Jane's stepbrother, William, leaves the family due to the protracted feud with their father, who soon after is charged for embezzling.
Days pass by and one day, Jane receives an envelope sent anonymously. Inside, there is a tiny piece of cerulean stone and right in front of Jane's eyes a mysterious phenomenon occurs...

Because he's trapped, Chiaki starts to question exactly how far he can possibly go in music, especially when he's passed over again and again for others he thinks are less worthy of musical scholarship and fame.
Recently dumped by his girlfriend for a sausage looking fellow, passed over for a chance to go overseas, removed from his star spot in the piano competition because he walked out on his piano instructor, Chiaki is at his limit.

With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated.

He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death.

A manga artist is asked by her boss to accompany him and a travel-writer on various train trips around Japan and draw a manga about it.
The travel-writer turns out to be a super train-otaku who has vast knowledge of the train network, but also micro-manages all their trips, planning every detail down to the second. He cares mostly about following the schedule and successfully achieving his planned goals, e.g. visiting all stations on a line in an unusual order to accommodate infrequent trains. The mangaka does not really care about trains; she is cynical, sarcastic, and rather lazy. She mainly just looks forward to the next eki-ben. This difference in personality and interests inevitably lead to bizarre conflicts. written by Miles Bader (edited)Note: The anime is actually completely non-fictional Â the creator really did go on all these trips, and the manga simply records what happened, thus presenting various out of the way and interesting Japanese train lines and stations.

714,5522,Yatterman,TV Series,6.07,"Adventure, Comedy, Parody",60,11,2008,0,"* A remake from the '70 classic Yatterman series. Almost 31 years after the beginning of the original series, a remake has started airing on Yomiuri TV, basically a retelling of the original story updated to fit the tastes of a more modern public.
Doronbo trio's boss Dokurobei sends the gang to find five Dokuro Rings (in the original series there was only the Dokuro Stone) that when united, they will grant any wish.
Ganchan, still a young genius, is now a slacker, easily distracted, and a foil for the the more serious, reliable and responsible Ai-chan. Ai-chan itself is now mellowed in a cuter, childlike personality, at least in her flirtatious relationship with Ganchan: in this reloading of the myth, Yatterwan was meant as a birthday gift for her, to ease her desire to go driving with her boyfriend. As a gift for Ai-chan, and displaying some degree of preference for her instead of his creator, Yatterwan appears now more incline to follow every whim and order of her mistress instead of the ones given by Ganchan himself. Aside from this quirk, Yatterwan is still the same, acting in battle as his former incarnation. The plot has stayed largely the same, sporting an episodical structure in which the Doronbo Gang plots a scam, that usually backfires in a spectacular way; they're engaged by Dokurobee to get the Dokuro Ring hidden elsewhere with a new mecha of their own making, they're stopped by Yatterwan, with the surplus energy given by the ""Mecha Food"" supplied by Ai-chan, and they're left tattered and in rags to be punished by Dokurobee himself.~ Description taken from Wikipedia, and modified a little by XellosPL

The legendary swordsmith Shikizaki Kiki made 1000 swords in his career. The more of these swords a state had, the greater the success in battle. When the Shogun emerged victorious, he collected 988 of the swords... but those were only the swordsmith's inferior practice pieces. For the final twelve swords were the pinnacle of his career. Each of them has powers so extraordinary, that one man wielding one of them could defeat a small army.
Shogunate strategist Togame has been ordered to recover all of them. She first hired a ninja... but the worth of the swords is so great the entire ninja clan defected the moment they recovered one. Then she hired a swordsman... though bound by honour, he felt he should keep the sword for himself.
Her last hope is Shichika, the seventh and last practitioner of the Kyotoryuu â the No Sword School. He and his sister live on an island cut off from civilization â so they have no need or use for money. His sword school does not use swords either â so he would not want the swords for himself.
So why should he help Togame?""Because you will fall in love with me.""Source: EasternStandard.pbworks.com

The Holy Grail War is a death-match between 7 magi (Masters) and their summoned heroic spirits (Servants). In this battle royale, the prize is the legendary Holy Grail, said to be an omnipotent wish-granting device which will produce any sort of miracle in order to bend reality to accommodate the wishes it grants. The winning Master and Servant shall be granted one wish each, after which the Holy Grail will not be activated until the next War.
The 4th Holy Grail War is about to take place, and the 3 preceding Wars had ended without a victor. In pursuit of their individual goals and ambitions, the competing magi congregate at a Japanese city called Fuyuki. All the magi will do anything, rationalize away any atrocity, in pursuit of the Holy Grail. All of them, but one.Kotomine Kirei is a Master, but one without a reason to fight. Unable to release himself from the threads of Fate, he is reluctantly drawn into the War. To enter the War, he even had to stray from his path in the Holy Church and join the ranks of the Mage's Association, an organization with which the Church is not on good terms, but which it has to tolerate and sometimes even cooperate with.
However, as Fate would ironically have it, one of his rival Masters, Emiya Kiritsugu, is a man more merciless than anyone else, an assassin who killed many people and intervened in many conflicts, for reasons no one is able to understand. Kirei's fight against this interesting yet strange sort of enemy might prove to be his most troubling task so far. Kiritsugu is equally puzzled by Kirei, and both of them still have the other Masters and Servants to take care of. written by Hinoe

In this country, gods reside within everything. There are said to be a countless number of gods. They exist not only in pebbles rolling the streets, but in buildings and other works of man, in animals and grass, and even in physical phenomena, such as weather. Gods dwell in all things known to man and control them. Among these gods, there is a hierarchy. A god of higher rank has control over gods of lower ranks and may make them change their forms as he sees fit. This is known as Transformation. The supreme god at the top of this hierarchy, who rules over all other gods, is Amaterasu. All gods change their forms as Amaterasu wishes through Transformations, shaping the world exactly as the supreme god wants it. And that was the great power I inherited, I maintained, and I held control of.
However... At this point in time, the power of Amaterasu belongs to my brother, of all people. One could say he is currently the supreme god. That is why, when he wishes for something, the many other gods seeking his favor, often undergo Transformations. The Valentine's Day disaster the other day was one such instance. To serve his desires, those gods changed my body into chocolate and urged him to consume it. Fortunately, the Yagami sisters â Tsurugi, Kagami, and Tama â stepped in and suppressed the Transformations. I am not clear on exactly what they are, but what is clear is that they can wield divine powers of high-ranking gods. It appears that I will need to keep them under surveillance along with my brother. That is all."" â Tsukuyomi Sasami
